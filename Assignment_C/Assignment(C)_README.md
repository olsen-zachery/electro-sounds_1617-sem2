//Generative Art Description & Analysis

//The Processing project that I will be describing is the "Fall in Love - Phantogram" from the Processing Exhibition. It was created by Timothy Saccenti and Joshua Davis for a music video for Phantogram's Voices album campaign. They used the HYPE framework in Processing.

//I like the images from this project because of how they used many small objects, to create a bigger aesthetic. For example, they either used small dots or squares and spread them out with varying positions, sizes & rotations.

//The sketch most likely uses an ArrayList so that they could create many objects of the same type, while changing small details with every individual object in the image.

//I made a sketch that emulates the texture of some of their images. I was trying to recreate the snake-like texture the lines with dots made, but was unable to.
