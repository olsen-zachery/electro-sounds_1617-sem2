Video Title: "Changes" 

# Video

# Project Description

The visuals used included heavily on basic shapes such as lines, rectangles, cubes, and spheres. These objects were made to rotate, move towards the viewer & overlap. I had wanted for these basic shapes to create a new aesthetic by overlaying them. 

The soundtrack I used was written by me to support the simple feel to the video. The song itself has many sine-tones and elementary sound synthesis. Yet, those sounds were used to create a lush but modern song take that modern music listeners would be familiar with.
